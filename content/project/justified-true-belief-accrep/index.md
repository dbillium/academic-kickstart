<h1>Project Overview</h1>
This project is a replication of Experiment 1 from Turri, Buckwalter, and Blouw (2015) conducted at Wittenberg University as part of the Accelerated CREP.

<h2>Procedure</h2>
Participants will be recruited from psychology courses at Wittenberg University offering research participation credit. Participants will complete the study online at a time and place of their choosing by following a link to the SocSciSurvey questionnaire. After completing the study, participants will be redirected to a separate debriefing page that will allow them to provide information needed to grant their research participation credit.

In the study, participants read three vignettes ("Darrel", "Gerald", and "Emma") presented in random order without replacement. Each vignette was randomly assigned to a belief condition (knowledge control, Gettier case, and ignorance control) and counter-balanced to ensure that each participant experienced all three vignettes and all three belief conditions once. Randomization, condition assignment, and counter-balancing was conducted automatically by the SocSciSurvey system used to administer the survey.

For each vignette, participants will be asked to respond to several questions before moving on to the next vignette, including ratings of the extent to which the person in each vignette "knows" versus "only believes".

<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
Consistent with the original Turri et al. (2015) findings, we predict that participants will rate vignettes from the knowledge control and Gettier case conditions similarly high in "knowing" compared to lower ratings of "knowing" for the ignorance control condition.
