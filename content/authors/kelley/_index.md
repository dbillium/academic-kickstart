# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research program is focused on self-regulation which refers to the conscious and non-conscious processes that enable individuals to guide their thoughts, feelings, and behaviours in a purposeful manner. In particular, my work takes a social neuroscientific perspective to examining the ways in which personality, social, and cognitive processes influence goal pursuit and well-being.
